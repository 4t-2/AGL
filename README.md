# AGL - Another Graphics Library - alpha
AGL is a C++ graphics library that helps make displaying graphics easy and simple, it uses X11 for the window management and OpenGL for drawing graphics onto the screen. It's syntax takes heavy inspiration from SFML so it is object-oriented.

## Why
This reason for making this is that I wanted a graphics library that had 3D support but I didnt want to use something like GLFW as it is very bare bones in that you need to manually make the OpenGL calls to do anything, so I decided to make a library that lets you code in a syntax similar to SFML but also let you make both 2D and 3D programs.

## Dependencies
- Xorg
- OpenGL
- GLEW
